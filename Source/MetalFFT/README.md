FFT (Fast Fourier transform) in Metal shading language
======================

In this folder you will find an implementation of a 2D fast Fourier transform written in Metal shading language and Swift. This is merely very simple and unoptimized implementation. If you are not using the GPU for other computations you will probably be better off using [vDSP's FFT](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/vdsp/fast_fourier_transforms) functions.
